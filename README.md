# MyWordle

This was an attempt to get accepted to C++ Academy at evosoft Hungary by creating this entry level program.<br>
(The original game can be found at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)<br>
Got me selected to the second round so I decided to put it out here.<br><br>
### Usage:<br>
Download the executable (Built for 64-bit Windows) and the words.txt file in the same directory and double-click MyWordle.exe<br>
When the security warning pops up, click "Run anyway".<br><br><br>
Many thanks to StackOverflow community in general because I was too nervous to take notes while I was frantically writing code and copy/pasting code others wrote to make this happen until deadline.
