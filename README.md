# MyWordle

This was an attempt to get accepted to C++ Academy at evosoft Hungary by creating this entry level program.<br>
Got me selected to the second round so I decided to put it out here.<br><br>
Usage: put the executable and the words.txt file in the same directory and run. (Built for 64-bit Windows)<br><br><br>
Many thanks to StackOverflow community in general because I was too nervous to take notes while I was frantically writing code and copy/pasting code others wrote to make this happen until deadline.
