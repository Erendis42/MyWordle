# MyWordle

This was an attempt to get accepted to C++ Academy at evosoft Hungary by creating this entry level program.<br>
Got me selected to the second round so I decided to put it out here.<br><br>
Usage: put the executable and the words.txt file in the same directory and run. (Built for 64-bit Windows)
